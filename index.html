      <h2>About Pat's Salmon Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        We are dedicated to quality and sustainability. Our salmon cookies are made with wild-caught salmon and fresh local ingredients sourced from within Washington State. We use finely ground salmon along with whole wheat flour to create delicious goodies that you won't be able to get enough of! We also have gluten-free varieties. Our cookies are an essential source of omega-3s and protein; they are a balanced part of your daily diet, and they taste delicious!

        Pat has been baking salmon cookies for over ten years. When she first started catering the cookies for weddings, they were a big hit and people could not believe that their main ingredient was salmon. Pat has decided to share her creations with the Greater Seattle Area, and she can't wait for you to try them! See below for some photos of what she offers at Pat's Salmon Cookies.

        <q>Pat's salmon cookies changed my life! Before, I used to only eat extremely sugary, over-processed cookies for breakfast, but after I switched to Pat's cookies, I lost 25 lbs and feel healthier than ever! Thank you, Pat. I'm never going back!</q>

        <q>At first, I thought salmon cookies would be really gross and fishy, but it's actually quite delicious. They are the perfect blend of savory and sweet, and they are really filling. Sometimes I make a trip down from Lynnwood just for Pat's salmon cookies!</q>

        <q>Pat must be a Leo because she is sooooo creative. Everything she makes is the best thing I've ever tasted.</q>

        <q>I love salmon cookies and my mom lets me eat them for breakfast. Usually she does not let me eat cookies for breakfast, but she says that these are healthier than that cereal crap that I eat, and if I keep eating the cereal, I will get diabetes. I don't want to get diabetes. Once, I had a nightmare about that fish, though.</q>
